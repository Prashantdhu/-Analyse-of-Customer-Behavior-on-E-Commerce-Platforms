**Introduction**

The retail landscape has undergone a profound transformation over the past decade.
Traditional stores have been supplemented and in the majority of cases replaced by online
storefronts also known as e-commerce platforms. E-commerce platforms have redefined the
way people shop offering variety, convenience, and accessibility. In just a matter of the last two
years e-commerce sales increased by 67.5% in the Canadian retail market alone. As the
customer demand for more convenient ways of shopping increases, understanding their
behavior becomes an essential paramount for businesses to thrive. Thus, the aim of our project
is to analyze customer behavior on e-commerce platforms for the sake of customer retention. As
the use of e-commerce continues to evolve, it becomes important for businesses to conduct
strategic methods to understand customer behavior to target and enhance customer experience
ultimately correlating with higher sales.

The primary objective of our project is to analyze and understand attributes and factors
that influence customer behavior on e-commerce platforms. The analysis will provide valuable
and explicit information regarding customer behavior on e-commerce which is an important
insight that businesses can use to improve their services and enhance customer satisfaction.

**Dataset**

The dataset selected for undertaking our objective of diving deeper into online customer
behavior is a comprehensive collection of customer interactions and purchasing patterns within
the leading e-commerce ecosystem. The initial purpose of the author was to find out which
customers would churn. Customers who churn, in this context, refers to customers who do not
return to the respective e-commerce platform. In essence, the authorâ€™s intention with their
dataset is similar to our objective.

This dataset offers a structured and tabular format. It is organized into rows and
columns, making it suitable for traditional analysis techniques. Each row represents a unique
customer interaction and activity with respect to the e-commerce platform, while each column
represents a specific attribute or variable associated with those interactions. It is worth
mentioning that there are some missing values which will be explained in more detail in the data
cleaning section of the task section.

This dataset has 5360 unique values collected from 2019, that is 5360 unique customer
interactions, and 20 columns. Each column provides crucial information that can be used for
analysis.
